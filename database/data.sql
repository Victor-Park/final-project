  'STM Dry Clutch Kit',
  'Unleash the best side of your bike with genuine accessories for your Ducati Panigale V4 by Ducati Performance.

Same dry clutch kit as found on the Panigale V4R model, this kit is specifically made to fit your Panigale V4 and V4S (including Speciale).

The dry clutch conversion kit includes an STM EVO-SBK clutch that has a billet aluminum housing and a 38 tooth plate pack.

This dry clutch also benefits from a more effective slipper function, allowing for more smooth aggressive downshifts and off throttle stages.

The dry clutches also require less parasitic drivetrain loss since the clutch is not spinning in oil, this also ensures oil to stay cleaner since clutch material will not end up in the oil like it does in a wet clutch setup.

Please note that this is a special order product and may take up to 2-3 weeks to ship.

  'Brembo Racing GP4RX CNC Nickel Plated Calipers',
  'Machined entirely from billet, the GP4 RX calipers are much lighter than any comparable product and features a mass to stiffness ratio which is unrivaled in its class.

Utilizing four 32mm diameter pistons, the Brembo GP4RX calipers have the renowned power and controllability you would expect from Brembo calipers.

The GP4-RX calipers pads slide within the body on special guides, which eliminates the use of the pad pins.  Also the GP4-RX is the first ever product to use a surface treatment that has been adapted directly from MotoGP.

To finish off the caliper, it has been nickel plated, which not only creates a very attractive look, but it has also allowed the Brembo engineers to make the machining tolerances even finer, which added the benefits of performance and extremely high operating precision.

Brembo Part Number : 220B01020

NOTE: When using these calipers on a Ducati Panigale model, the master cylinder must be changed to the Brembo RCS19 or RCS19 Corsa Corta or 19x18 or 19x20 master cylinder.',
